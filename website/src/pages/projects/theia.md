# THEIA in closed beta

The scope of a fight against climate change is enormous, and strategic investment is our most important tool in a fight against it. Yet still, people at the forefront of that fight – individuals, medium and small businesses and local governments are left almost blind when they are forced to make the crucial decisions on how to distribute the limited resources they have available.

To solve this problem, we are developing a suite of tools aiming to provide the much needed insight into the local climate, from urban heat island effect, through power loss on transmission lines to thermal insulation analyses of buildings.

With this we are pleased to present our first publicly available project nicknamed THEIA.

THEIA is an automated drone monitoring platform aiming to allow data collection at scale by beeing cheap, durable, easly modifiable and extendable. With the use of state of the art AI algorithms we are able to streamline the current arduous process while improving the precision of the measurement.

If you are interested in taking part in our closed beta/validation campaign or would like to book a demo, don’t hesitate to contact us at theia@randomscience.org
